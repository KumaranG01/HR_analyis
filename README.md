Abstract
Today's world, every company is interested in predicting employee performance and
attrition based on employee performance evaluations conducted quarterly or
semi-annually. The company's growth is determined by how talented their current
employees are. However, predictive analysis of employee performance and attrition
gives the company an advantage in analyzing and making business decisions based on
the results. Predictive analytics is a machine learning technique that uses techniques
such as classification to predict future performance or a data point we request to be
predicted using 80 percent train data and 20% test data. Furthermore, classification is
a data mining technique that aligns attributes in a dataset to target specific groups or
categories. Binary classification techniques such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector
machines, and decision trees are used to predict employee attrition. In this paper, we
would like to apply a random forest classification technique that employs the
ensemble classification method to predict from the results of multiple decision
trees.Random forest classification, in particular, emphasizes high predictive accuracy
and low computational cost. Finally, random forest is recommended alongside binary
classification techniques such as decision tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes because it
outperforms due to high predictive accuracy.
